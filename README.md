# War Cards Game

### The idea:  
Me and my friends asked ask ourselves if cards war has an end to it. It seems that the game can go forever.  
  
So I decided to write a program in Java to check if the game has an end, and if so - that is the  
average number of turns in a game.
  
The conclusion is that there is an end to a game! and the average turns number is ~320.
  
### the classes in the project:  
Card  
Represent card in the deck. Has only value of number. We dont need the suit type in war game.  
  
Deck  
Represent deck of cards.  
Used as the full card deck at the beginning of the game, also as personal deck of player and also as bank of cards during the game. 
The data structure that holds the cards is ArrayList, in future will be changed to Stack.
  
Player  
Each player has a deck and bank of cards
  
Main
Runs all the game.  
Soon will be changed to new class named Game.
